A digital image is a numeric representation (a matrix) of an image f(x,y) that has been discretized both in spatial coordinates and brightness.
# Option to load an example image: img = data.horse() img = data.moon() img = data.astronaut() img = data.coins() io.imshow(img) io.show() # Or load your own image instead (though it might not be ideal for the demo).


## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/afteriwoof/Image_processing_seminar/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
